Here’s my proposed solution:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. For questions related to a specific well-known language, always use a language-specific tag, e.g. [tag:tolkien-sindarin]. Don’t tag your own project that no one has heard of like that though. Don’t use any -language or -conlang suffixes for these, that’s just redundant. E.g. [tag:klingon] not [tag:klingon-language] &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; a. For questions about how such a conlang was developed, changed during its development, and also how it was received or adapted by learners, [tag:conlang-history] seems appropriate as an additional tag.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. For questions about how to make a conlang, I suggest [tag:conlang-creation].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; a. For questions which are relevant to a specific subfield of linguistics, additional tags such as [tag:phonology] would be appropriate.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; b. I would also like to emphasize that simulating natural language change is a thing that some conlangers do, here [tag:diachronics] is particularly appropriate.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. Various questions regarding conlanging terminology can take a [tag:terminology] tag, and similarly for classification stuff there can be [tag:classification]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;4. Questions about creating scripts (including stuff like making fonts) get [tag:neography], questions about writing in general [tag:writing-systems]. Overlap exists, but shouldn’t be cause for worry. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; a. For certain constructed scripts such as Tengwar, specific tags might be appropriate. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; b. What is our opinion on spelling reforms? Are such discussions even on-topic? If yes, [tag:spelling-reform] might be useful.

I hope you'll hear me out.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I haven't yet asked a question on the site, and because of that (and the fact that we're still in private beta), going to the Ask Question link gives me [a nice little bit of advice](https://conlang.stackexchange.com/questions/ask/advice?). I've been through something like a dozen private betas, and, for the most part, asked questions on each one, but I still read this little spiel every time around. The last paragraph of it has always stuck with me:&#xD;&#xA;&gt; #You get the site you build&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The first questions set the tone and topic of a site for a long time. Those early questions say a lot about what your community could become. And questions asked during the private beta will be on the front page when potential experts see your site for the first time. So please make those first questions exemplary ones that are interesting, challenging, and worthy of imitation. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If feel like a more generic version of this geared towards both questions *and* answers would make a really great bit of recommended reading for a private beta. **All the posts we write at the moment set precedent,** and assuming that we make it out of private beta - not that we should assume that - they'll set the site's course for years to come. If we write awesome answers, then folks down the line will be encouraged to do the same. If we write crappy answers, then we're not going to get anywhere. Fixing that sort of problem is hard.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As an example, I'd like to mention that there's a Stack Exchange site (I won't name it) that I use a lot. I really enjoy writing answers there. I've been on it for several years, although I missed its birth by about ten months. After a while contributing, I looked back at the earliest posts. And . . . many of them were *not good*. At all. And that's kinda frustrating. Did the site get better? Yes, eventually, because people who were motivated to write fantastic posts came in. But things could just as easily have gone the other way. **That's why this is an important issue.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That's Point #1. Point #2 is that the quality of an answer is just as important as the content. I've only written three answers because it's taken me kind of a while to write them. (Part of that is putting in effort; part of that is that my knowledge in certain areas is incomplete.) In two cases, before I'd finished writing, other folks had written answers with, to some extent, the same information.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You could make a case for one of two actions: Posting the answer, or not posting it. In both instances, I chose the latter, because I felt that my answer was more complete, or made a different argument to support the conclusions. I say this not to toot my own horn - honestly, maybe my answers were crappy and not worth posting; I'm not an impartial judge - but to try to not discourage people if they run up against a [Fastest Gun in the West](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/9731/274942) situation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Just because someone writes an answer doesn't mean that yours can't be better. Even if they got a bunch of quick upvotes, you still might have something to add. Is this always the case? Definitely not. I've aborted a couple of answers here because even though I was close to finished, someone else wrote something great. And of course an answer that just duplicates another probably isn't worth anything. But I want people to know that **there's always room for another answer,** so long as it brings something substantial a new to the table - new information, a new view, a new rationale."

The main difference here seems to be that the quantity of potential questions in this category is significantly higher, since while other sites only deal with one language, we deal with many.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think such resource requests would be as useful as they are on sites dedicated to a single language.

However, I think we can reasonably judge which conlangs posts like this are likely to work for by a few criteria:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * lesser-known languages, such as someone's personal project that doesn't have any &quot;fluent&quot; or dedicated speakers, are unlikely to benefit from such a post, as the majority of the resources are likely to be in the same place: the author's documentation of the language&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * simple languages such as relexes or place-naming languages also probably wouldn't gain much either, since there's not really much to learn to begin with, and any relevant answers would simply be links to dictionaries&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the other hand, such resource requests would certainly work for widely spoken conlangs like Esperanto (although perhaps its dedicated site would be a better place), Klingon, or High Valyrian, for the same reasons that the various natural language sites have these posts. They could also be useful for well-known but sparsely-documented or -spoken conlangs such as [Occidental / Interlingue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occidental_language), for which resources may be difficult to find."

Text="I agree with this, and I have a couple of additional points I want to make. I hope you'll hear me out.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I haven't yet asked a question on the site, and because of that (and the fact that we're still in private beta), going to the Ask Question link gives me [a nice little bit of advice](https://conlang.stackexchange.com/questions/ask/advice?). I've been through something like a dozen private betas, and, for the most part, asked questions on each one, but I still read this little spiel every time around. The last paragraph of it has always stuck with me:&#xD;&#xA;&gt; #You get the site you build&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The first questions set the tone and topic of a site for a long time. Those early questions say a lot about what your community could become. And questions asked during the private beta will be on the front page when potential experts see your site for the first time. So please make those first questions exemplary ones that are interesting, challenging, and worthy of imitation. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If feel like a more generic version of this geared towards both questions *and* answers would make a really great bit of recommended reading for a private beta. **All the posts we write at the moment set precedent,** and assuming that we make it out of private beta - not that we should assume that - they'll set the site's course for years to come. If we write awesome answers, then folks down the line will be encouraged to do the same. If we write crappy answers, then we're not going to get anywhere. Fixing that sort of problem is hard.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As an example, I'd like to mention that there's a Stack Exchange site (I won't name it) that I use a lot. I really enjoy writing answers there. I've been on it for several years, although I missed its birth by about ten months. After a while contributing, I looked back at the earliest posts. And . . . many of them were *not good*. At all. And that's kinda frustrating. Did the site get better? Yes, eventually, because people who were motivated to write fantastic posts came in. But things could just as easily have gone the other way. **That's why this is an important issue.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That's Point #1. Point #2 is that the quality of an answer is just as important as the content. I've only written three answers because it's taken me kind of a while to write them. (Part of that is putting in effort; part of that is that my knowledge in certain areas is incomplete.) In two cases, before I'd finished writing, other folks had written answers with, to some extent, the same information.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You could make a case for one of two actions: Posting the answer, or not posting it. In both instances, I chose the former, because I felt that my answer was more complete, or made a different argument to support the conclusions. I say this not to toot my own horn - honestly, maybe my answers were crappy and not worth posting; I'm not an impartial judge - but to try to not discourage people if they run up against a [Fastest Gun in the West](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/9731/274942) situation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Just because someone writes an answer doesn't mean that yours can't be better. Even if they got a bunch of quick upvotes, you still might have something to add. Is this always the case? Definitely not. I've aborted a couple of answers here because even though I was close to finished, someone else wrote something great. And of course an answer that just duplicates another probably isn't worth anything. But I want people to know that **there's always room for another answer,** so long as it brings something substantial a new to the table - new information, a new view, a new rationale."

We do have two sites - [Puzzling](https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/) and [Programming Puzzles &amp; Code Gofl](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/) - dedicated to solving puzzles, but there's one key feature: **Those sites are explicitly designed for puzzles**. The other Stack Exchange sites are not.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The official, tongue-in-cheek position of Stack Exchange is that [We Hate Fun](https://stackoverflow.blog/2010/01/04/stack-overflow-where-we-hate-fun/). Obviously, that's not totally true; we do have fun things like [Winter Bash](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/270508/274942) semi-regularly, and chat rooms are more laid-back. But on the whole, we keep things serious. It's not really that we hate fun; it's just that it distracts from the serious, real-life problems that people have.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This sort of thing is especially true on small beta sites. I've got no idea what sort of activity Constructed Languages will see in the future, but it won't be huge, maybe five questions a day in the coming months (if we get past private beta). This means that if we get one puzzle question every day or two - and we would get that many, if not more - then 10-20% of the site would be for fun. That ratio's higher than I think most people would like.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That said, we could maybe do this sort of thing in [chat](https://chat.stackexchange.com/), maybe having a weekly game session, where it would be tucked away and wouldn't distract from the main site (although there's plenty of serious business in chat). Maybe a custom room could be made, so the site's main chat room can remain open for more serious stuff. But I wouldn't recommend having this sort of contest on the site itself."

Within organic chemistry, suggesting syntheses to various organic compounds using known reactions is considered an interesting puzzle. Often, the goal is to find elegant pathways that please the organic chemist’s eye and with as few reactions as possible. There’s a reason why chemists speak of the *art* (and not science) of total synthesis.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The way the challenges — which are subsumed under the umbrella tag [tag:synthesis-golf] and which are explained [in this chem.meta.SE question][2] for those interested — work is that they are posted once *every month*, users have the chance to submit their answers and finally the accepted answer is awarded to the route with the lowest number of steps (assuming the community agrees by voting that the route will likely work).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This would immediately set an outline of when and how this would be possible.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Chemistry receives some [thirty questions per day][3] yet the challenges are only once a month. The ratio of normal questions to [tag:synthesis-golf] questions is about 900 to 1. (Note, however, that Chemistry has a [somewhat unhealthy closing rate][4].)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - While the challenge in itself seems simple, the main question posters take special care to ensure that the challenge is neither too hard (= no answers) nor too easy. They have misjudged a few times which lead to a daunting drop in answers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - A challenge needs an unambiguous way to award the checkmark; i.e. a way to measure the goodness of answers. I consider choosing the first answer would be a very bad design principle. Choosing the highest-voted answer would work partially, but chances are that it is just the first answer that rises highest. I’m not sure how one would rate the answers since any constraint I am imagining *right now* seems very abusable when one has full control over the output.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; (That does not mean that a good method does not exist, it means I can’t think of one off the top of my head.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; Of course, if the asker has designed the challenge in a way that leaves only one correct answer, then FGITW is a valid checkmark selecting method.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think it would be a good idea to implement at some point in the future but not before a steady stream of ‘normal’ questions come in.

Of course, our policies can always be changed but some policy changes are harder than others.&#xA;&#xA;I don’t think that there is a clear good or bad, right or wrong answer to the question *a priori*, we’ll have to see how they work out in practice.

The process was tedious because of how immensely popular these questions were. But it had to be done because only an infinitesimally small number of users actually bothered to read the guidelines and it was all just a way for people to gain badges in the close vote review queue. I suspect that there was very early precedence that just unfolded in a very bad way. In the end, the mods went through and deleted all questions except for a few exemplary one worth retaining which were fitted with a historical lock. Even with these few remaining, the blacklisted tag remained the highest-used.&#xA;&#xA;Because of the work that all of this was, it is best if we put off the final decision until we see what it is *actually* going to turn into when the site goes live and attracts traffic through Google."

I also have made small edits to questions and titles to improve answerability and have weighed in on opening and closing threads. I have also participated in meta discussions. I have enthusiasm about this site and a level head. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am known by my friends and by those in other online communities I spend time in as &quot;chill&quot; and &quot;mellow about drama&quot; -- while I am good at listening to others complaints and hearing them out, I don't overreact to trolling and insults, and I only take action when truly necessary. However, when it is clear action needs to be taken, I do not hesitate. I am decisive, firm, and fair.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Obviously, I accept this nomination.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I live in Ohio (USA) and am generally active from 5:00pm to 1:00am EST (that's 22:00--6:00 GMT)."

On the contrary, I'm precisely asking about features in human languages that are based on our anatomy. A reasonable restriction about the anatomical parts is not very helpful—if I had restricted it to our ears or eyes of number of limbs it would void the usefulness of the question, which is to find out which are concepts I hadn't thought about myself.

My answer here is mainly based on my perspective about what I've seen on these other sites.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My experience is that, at least for many people, pushback is strongest against **advocacy** of auxiliary languages. Yes, many people on these sites are more interested in &quot;naturalistic&quot; conlangs, but I think there are definitely people who would be interested in discussing linguistic aspects of auxililary languages and engineered languages. (For example, the Conlang Mailing List has seen a fair number of posts by the creators of engineered, non-naturalistic constructed languages.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An issue that often seems to come up is that the set of people who are interested in posting about auxiliary languages overlaps significantly with the set of people who are interested in promoting auxiliary languages. It is tiresome when people who think they've come up with the next Esperanto make posts arguing about why their language is the greatest, especially if it's obvious that the poster hasn't taken much time to study linguistics or the alternative existing auxiliary languages that already exist.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think the Stack Exchange model of questions and answers is inherently more hostile to advocacy efforts than the bulletin-board or mailing-list discussion paradigms, so I wouldn't think that would be as big a problem on this site, and I expect that there should accordingly be less hostility towards ***on-topic*** posts about auxiliary languages and engineered languages here.

As such, when being presented with an example sentence in a conlang, the average reader on this site sees exactly gibberish. There are two questions here:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### 1. Is this a problem?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Given a question on Toki Pona or Lojban, the person who is asking a question is likely at least somewhat familiar with the language and may not require extended explanations or direct translations of features unrelated to the question at hand. For example, in [this](https://conlang.stackexchange.com/questions/386/how-does-one-express-want-to-want-in-toki-pona) question here, as of me writing this question, the accepted answer simply features two example sentences in Toki Pona, which the OP presumably understood (or they wouldn’t have accepted the answer). To me as someone who is not familiar with the language’s grammar however, it is unintelligible. I would have been interested in seing the answer stated in a way that I can learn something as well, however. Whether this is a) necessary and b) even desired is in the air.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It can however become an indesputable problem if someone requires help with a feature of their own constructed language. To showcase the context, they will likely require to give some form of examples, and people capable of answering will need to be able to parse those examples, preferrably without much trouble.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another thing that has to be considered is that examples will not always be about the grammatical structure. Sometimes the focus may be on phonology, in which case the meanings of individual words might be interesting, but not relevant.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The question then is, in what cases do we consider bare example sentences problematic?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### 2. In cases where we consider it to be a problem, what can we do about it?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Probably the easier question to answer: How do we want people to present example sentences? Do we require [glosses](https://www.eva.mpg.de/lingua/resources/glossing-rules.php), explanations? Do we require a romanization if the language is not written in the latin script?

Is this a problem?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I believe (and I wouldn’t have made this post otherwise) this to be a problem in general. In my opinion, while the main focus of an answer should be answering the question at hand, to the person who asked it, sharing knowledge with other people who might read it is always valuable and can set apart a decent answer from a great one. As such, I would consider an absolutely bare sentence in a conlang to never be good practice. Thus, not like this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Pes qune wasi lxelxasac p’eknuim nuk’gojet.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### 2. In cases where we consider it to be a problem, what can we do about it?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As alluded to in the actual question, a primary distinction ought to be made between sentences where the meaning is relevant (grammar or semantics questions) and those where it’s not (phonology questions). In the former, I would suggest that at a minimum, a literal as well as an idiomatic translation should be provided, like this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Pes qune wasi lxelxasac p’eknuim nuk’gojet.**  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; What that I in-lxelxe say you-don’t-understand  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; “You can’t understand what I say in Lxelxe.”&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This can often already be enough to get a good feeling of the grammar involved without much additional effort. Especially when wanting to highlight morphology however, a [gloss] is extremely useful. Ideally some implementation to easily create pretty glosses would be amazing, lacking that however they can be created somewhat okayishly using code blocks:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Pes qune wasi lxelxasac p’eknuim nuk’gojet.**&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt;     pes  qune wasi lxelxa-sac     p’eknu-im nuk’-goj-et&#xD;&#xA;&gt;     what COMP 1    lxelxe.OBL-INE say-1s    understand-NEG-2s&#xD;&#xA;&gt; “You can’t understand what I say in Lxelxe.”&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To anyone with some experience in linguistics, regardless of what languages they are familiar with, this form of presentation gives a clear idea of the morphological structure. Depending on the goals, this may be overkill or actually obfuscate the relevant information - the fact that Lxelxe has an inessive case affix -sac which attaches to the oblique stem might not be relevant at all if the discussion was about relative clauses in that language. In such a case, glosses may be made more “informal”, mixing the structures presented in the two examples above, as appropriate. Additional information such as a clause grouping might also be indicated to further highlight the issue at hand:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Pes qune wasi lxelxasac p’eknuim nuk’gojet.**&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt;     pes  [qune wasi lxelxa-sac p’eknu-im] nuk’-goj-et&#xD;&#xA;&gt;     what [COMP 1    lxelxe-in  say-1s]    understand-NEG-2s&#xD;&#xA;&gt; “You can’t understand what I say in Lxelxe.”&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now on the other hand if the question was about pronunciation, all of this would be unnecessary. If the question for example was “How do relative clauses affect intonation in Lxelxe?”, then perhaps a good example illustrating this might look more like this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Pes qune wasi lxelxasac p’eknuim nuk’gojet.**  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ↑ˈpεs ˈqunɛ ˈwasi l̩ˈxεl̩ˌxε p’ɛknuˈim | nuk̚ˈ↑k’ɔjɛt&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This would then accompanied with some explanation, perhaps something along the lines of _As you can see, there is a pause after the end of the relative clause. The intonation rises sharply on the head of the relative clause and then stays relatively flat, tapering off slowly, over the duration of the clause. Intionation is essentially reset after the pause._&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Conclusion / TL;DR&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In my opinion, example sentences should always be provided with enough information that a reader can make sense of it, even if they don’t speak the language very well. However, this can easily be overdone as well. Information should not be added to the point where the actual answer is hidden behind it, but be supplementary information to the post. Often, examples aren’t needed at all, but if there are any, then they should be expanded upon enough that they are not just random strings of characters to the reader. Of course, this also implies that examples given in another script will probably benefit from a romanization under some circumstances, but only if this would help the understanding of the problem at hand.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[gloss]: https://www.eva.mpg.de/lingua/resources/glossing-rules.php" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

I'd argue that any answer that doesn't teach the OP something significant - and these, quite frankly, don't - is problematic insofar as it's probably not good. It might be downvoteable. Deleteable? I'd argue it's not; it does answer the question.

It gives content without context - and that's not good. I'd write something like&#xD;&#xA;&gt; This sentence does answer the OP's question. However, it doesn't teach them anything - it doesn't explain why the content makes sense, or how it should be constructed. Basically, it won't help the OP in the future. It would be nice if you could add some explanation about the structure of this sentence so people can learn something from this answer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That's just an example, but I think you get what I mean."

There are people who are interested in particular conlangs (e.g. the languages of Tolkien), and there is no debate that their questions are perfectly appropriate here.

I would go as far as to claim that for anyone who wants to make a naturalistic conlang² will predominantly have questions that might just as well feature on [linguistics.SE][ling].

You could just as well go to reddit, or a conlanging forum, or the linguistics department of your favourite university, and ask there. This should not be a sufficient reason to ban these questions here. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the other hand, I believe this kind of question brings immense value to the community: without them, a large section of active language constructors would be completely excluded from this site. I myself would likely never ask any questions anymore on this site, and I know quite a few people who feel the same. Conlanging _depends_ on linguistics, and as such, excluding it would be (as I wrote elsewhere already) like excluding questions on music theory on a composition forum. As such I believe that any linguistics question that is relevant to conlanging should have a place here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;# However, ...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I do believe that questions of this kind could be framed in a better way at times. Often, the person asking such a question has a very specific situation in mind that relates the question more closely to conlanging. I believe that where possible, we should encourage bringing the questions into context (by asking for context in comments, for example). To make an example, consider this (also grey-zone-y) question asked on this site by myself:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;https://conlang.stackexchange.com/questions/158/how-do-tones-disappear-from-a-language&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In this instance, I did not actually have any context to add. I am not currently working on any tonal languages that I might de-tonalize and was in fact just curious about it. However, imagine this was the case, then perhaps a better question might be phrased more along these lines:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In my constructed language, I have a tonal system with three tones (high, low, falling). Many words are mono- or bisyllabic, and there is a large amount of minimal pairs between words only distinguished by tones. I am currently deriving daughter languages from this language and would like for some of them to lose tone. However, I fear that in doing so, too much ambiguity will be created. What can I do to combat this?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, this question essentially asks the same thing, but the context makes it clearly conlanging-related, and on top also allows for more directed answers. While the former lands in the controversial grey zone discussed in this thread, the latter would be without any doubt on topic and a good question. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That said, I don’t believe that inventing context should be done either, which is why I’m not going to edit that old question of mine to contain the invented context above."

Comparative linguistics under this definition isn't really particularly relevant to conlanging, so I don't think having [tag:comparative-linguistics] as a tag synonym for [tag:typology] is a bad thing, but because &quot;typology&quot; is more technically accurate I believe it should be the master tag."

[tag:writing-systems]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Having both phrase and single word requests at ELU is a mess.

I'd include in this tag both the history of constructed languages as a discipline, as well as key moments in the development of particular languages,  from the human side of development, though not for questions about the development of languages themselves, which should be [tag:language-change]. [tag:history] for questions about people, [tag:language-change] for questions about languages themselves, if that makes sense.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- [tag:words] seems like a pretty useless tag.

Avoid asking multiple distinct questions at once. See the [How to Ask](https://conlang.meta.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-ask) page for help clarifying this question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Questions that have an unlimited number of answers are almost universally closed. This type of question would allow an unlimited number of answers - each conlang could get at least one answer, and &quot;answers presenting a new ad hoc conlang&quot; would only exacerbate that.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That already makes me wary - that there would be an unlimited number of possible answers to this &quot;challenge&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, while there are sites that have &quot;challenge&quot; questions, such as Puzzling.SE, they have specific rules for regulating them to fit on the site. Questions on Puzzling.SE that don't have a clearly correct answer are closed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Not useful**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If we take a look at the [help center](https://conlang.stackexchange.com/help/dont-ask), we'll also see some guidance:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Chatty, open-ended questions diminish the usefulness of our site and push other questions off the front page.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is basically the definition of an &quot;open-ended&quot; question, where every answer is equally valid.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The type of questions that you're proposing seem like they'd be **too broad, not useful, and not a good fit for the site**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Aside from that, though, the goal of the site is to create a repository of useful questions and answers about constructed languages - both existing ones and ones that people are creating. These don't seem like they'd fit into that goal - they'd be providing a sort of &quot;fun challenge&quot; for users, but they don't actually help the site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In fact, there's the possibility of *hurting* the site. If you have a fun, easy, but not the main point of the site type of question to ask, it can quickly grow and take over the site, drowning the site in these and making people uninterested in the site. See identification questions on Movies.SE and Anime.SE - they were flooded with low quality questions for years until they banned them. These seem like even less useful and lower-quality than identification questions." ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

(There's a small chance we'll need to [remove a nomination](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/274114/lets-disallow-nominations-from-people-whove-been-suspended-in-the-past-year), but I doubt that will come up.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* If there is an election, I'll announce the results on meta on April 16. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(Note for current moderators: there's no need to nominate yourself even though you'll likely get an email saying you should. The system assumes the first election is a graduation election, which would mean moderators would need to be re-elected. This isn't that sort of election.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you have any questions about the process, please stick them in an answer here." ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Invented languages are of course on topic at WB for valid reasons, but they may be even more on topic here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What I do is consider how much *weight* the OP is placing on the glossopoetics vs the geopoetics of the question.  For example, if someone asked **What Kinds of Linguistic Sounds Can an Intelligent / Sapient Hippogriff Pronounce**, I'd consider the weight there to be more towards worldbuilding, as it's a question of physiology and anatomy more than anything else.  If the question were **Okay, I Know What Kinds of Sounds a Hippogriff Can Make: What Strategies Can I Employ in Determining Which Sounds Might Be Used Linguistically**, I'd say that's right up Constructed Language's alley, and I would suggest a migration of that one.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, we've fielded questions like the first one here in CL before (there was one about a lipless humanoid a while back). If the first Hippogriff query were asked here, I wouldn't suggest migrating to WB unless the OP were really interested in the details of anatomy rather than language.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If the OP asked these two queries in both forums, I'd VTC the first query here in CL and VTC the other query in WB. Reason being, both have duplicates in better forums. It's a matter of keeping the question in the more appropriate place. An edit to the effect that there is a duplicate at CL within the body of the closed query on WB, if the question got any answers, would be a good idea." ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

I hope you'll hear me out.&#xA;&#xA;I haven't yet asked a question on the site, and because of that (and the fact that we're still in private beta), going to the Ask Question link gives me [a nice little bit of advice](https://conlang.stackexchange.com/questions/ask/advice?). I've been through something like a dozen private betas, and, for the most part, asked questions on each one, but I still read this little spiel every time around. The last paragraph of it has always stuck with me:&#xA;&gt; # You get the site you build&#xA;&gt;&#xA;&gt; The first questions set the tone and topic of a site for a long time. Those early questions say a lot about what your community could become. And questions asked during the private beta will be on the front page when potential experts see your site for the first time. So please make those first questions exemplary ones that are interesting, challenging, and worthy of imitation. &#xA;&#xA;If feel like a more generic version of this geared towards both questions *and* answers would make a really great bit of recommended reading for a private beta. **All the posts we write at the moment set precedent,** and assuming that we make it out of private beta - not that we should assume that - they'll set the site's course for years to come. If we write awesome answers, then folks down the line will be encouraged to do the same. If we write crappy answers, then we're not going to get anywhere. Fixing that sort of problem is hard.&#xA;&#xA;As an example, I'd like to mention that there's a Stack Exchange site (I won't name it) that I use a lot. I really enjoy writing answers there. I've been on it for several years, although I missed its birth by about ten months. After a while contributing, I looked back at the earliest posts. And . . . many of them were *not good*. At all. And that's kinda frustrating. Did the site get better? Yes, eventually, because people who were motivated to write fantastic posts came in. But things could just as easily have gone the other way. **That's why this is an important issue.**&#xA;&#xA;That's Point #1. Point #2 is that the quality of an answer is just as important as the content. I've only written three answers because it's taken me kind of a while to write them. (Part of that is putting in effort; part of that is that my knowledge in certain areas is incomplete.) In two cases, before I'd finished writing, other folks had written answers with, to some extent, the same information.&#xA;&#xA;You could make a case for one of two actions: Posting the answer, or not posting it. In both instances, I chose the former, because I felt that my answer was more complete, or made a different argument to support the conclusions. I say this not to toot my own horn - honestly, maybe my answers were crappy and not worth posting; I'm not an impartial judge - but to try to not discourage people if they run up against a [Fastest Gun in the West](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/9731/274942) situation.&#xA;&#xA;Just because someone writes an answer doesn't mean that yours can't be better. Even if they got a bunch of quick upvotes, you still might have something to add. Is this always the case? Definitely not. I've aborted a couple of answers here because even though I was close to finished, someone else wrote something great. And of course an answer that just duplicates another probably isn't worth anything. But I want people to know that **there's always room for another answer,** so long as it brings something substantial a new to the table - new information, a new view, a new rationale."

I'm not sure whether geolinguistics is the right term though. [Wikipedia says this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geolinguistics):&#xA;&#xA;&gt; One academic tradition with regard to geolinguistics as a branch of linguististics gives open recognition to the role map-making can play in linguistic research by seeing the terms dialect geography, language geography and linguistic geography as being synonymous with geolinguistics.&#xA;&gt;&#xA;&gt; A second linguistic tradition is that of The American Society of Geolinguistics which interprets geolinguistics to be &quot;An academic discipline involving the analysis and implications of the geographical location, distribution and structure of language varieties within a temporal framework, either in isolation or in contact and/or conflict with one another, being originally conceived of by Mario Pei as being a branch of linguistics which would be used to do objective-oriented research on real life language issues and where interdisciplinary approaches would be acceptable.&quot;&#xA;&#xA;Neither really match your question. I feel like I've seen another term for what you're asking about, but I can't remember what it was.&#xA;&#xA;Biolinguistics is probably a good enough term?

It seems, at first glance, that these type of questions are too subjective, but investigating what's wrong with a phonological system is educative.  &#xA;&#xA;Naturally, simple answers like 'do this' are wrong, and answers should not contain *what to do* but *how to do it*, talking about kitchen-sinkness, balance in phonological systems (and mass changes and chains that might occur there), phoneme occurence in systems and Euro-/Anglocentricism.  &#xA;&#xA;Furthermore, many new conlangers ask these questions (see [/r/conlangs's SD][rconlsd]) and can give the conlang SE more questions and views, as [Area 51 stats][a51s] show that the SE 'needs work'.  &#xA;&#xA;---&#xA;*Example:  &#xA;Proposed Q:&#xA;&gt; ## How natural my phonology?&#xA;&gt; This is my phonology for my language examplang.  &#xA;&gt; `PLOSIVE     | p b |      t d | k g |`  &#xA;&gt; `NASAL       |     |          |     |`  &#xA;&gt; `FRICATIVE   | f v | θ    s   | x   |`  &#xA;&gt; `APPROXIMANT |     |       ɹ  |  w  |`  &#xA;&gt; `FLAP/TAP    |     |       ɾ  |     |`  &#xA;&gt;  &#xA;&gt; `| i y     u`  &#xA;&gt; `|  e      `  &#xA;&gt; `|   ɛ   ɔ`  &#xA;&gt; `|    a`&#xA;&#xA;Ideal A:&#xA;&#xA;&gt; There are a couple things to notice. First, balance. The only voiced fricative is /v/, which is very unbalanced (although there *are exceptions* [with link]) and via sound changes, it might be removed or other voiced fricatives added. Then, the only front rounded vowel is /y/ and the Close-Mid row misses a back.  &#xA;&gt;&#xA;&gt; Then, occurrence. Less than 2% of languages have no nasal stops (Maddieson, Ian. 2008. Absence of Common Consonants. Accessed online at &lt;http://wals.info/feature/18&gt;). Also, /j l/ look quite common in a system like yours.  &#xA;&gt;&#xA;&gt; Common sound changes to evolve your phonological systems are: a chain in the vowels (which partially will fix irregularities), voicing when intervocalically (Old English had /f s ʃ h/ (or /x/), and borrowing /v/ from French added /v z ʒ/ due to balance), adding diphthongs via gemination (i.e. `Vr &gt; V[+gem]`, then `a: &gt; ai`, `e: &gt; ei`, `ɔ: &gt; o` (fixing unbalance), `i: y: &gt; i` (later inducing merger between /i y/ too) and use those diphthongs to get glides).&#xA;&#xA;A different question may have been answered including Anglo-/Eurocentricism, kitchen-sinkness and relex.&#xA;&#xA;  [rconlsd]: https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/comments/841sio/small_discussions_46_20180312_to_0325/&#xA;  [a51s]: https://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/101265/constructed-languages" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Your mission is to ask questions on that topic, direct people here who might have questions and so on. &#xA;&#xA;As a first topic, we shall start with Tense/Aspect/Mood/Evidentiality (TAME for short). Are you working on a conlang and are unsure if the interplay of your modals with the aspect system makes sense? Do you want to understand how Ithkuil’s mood system differs from that of natlangs or whether Lojban has anything like evidentiality marking ([it does](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Lojban/Attitudinals#Evidentials:))?
