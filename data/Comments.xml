  <row Id="293" PostId="24" Score="0" Text="@kiamlaluno You can apply other analogies as well, such as Code Review questions; some questions asking for code review on SO are on-topic and best asked there, others are off-topic there and on Code Review, others are off-topic there and on-topic at Code Review... it really depends on the question. Likewise there is precedent for this exact situation between IPS.SE and RPG.SE; RPG.SE has explicitly decided they want to be the expert community for IPS questions that relate to playing RPGs (table top, obviously, not digital). So IPS sends those folks to RPG when possible/prudent." CreationDate="2018-10-04T14:45:13.627" UserId="854" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />
